8. products.csv

These files contain information about customers, sellers, order items, geolocations, payments, reviews, orders, and products. Each file provides specific details related to the respective aspect of Target's operations in Brazil.

## Problem Statement
Assuming the role of a data analyst/scientist at Target, the task is to analyze the dataset to extract valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations. The analysis will involve various exploratory and in-depth examinations, focusing on aspects such as order trends, seasonality, customer behavior, economic impact, sales analysis, delivery efficiency, and payment patterns.

### What Does 'Good' Look Like?
1. Initial Exploration: Check the structure and characteristics of the dataset, including data types, time range of orders, and customer locations.
2. In-depth Exploration: Investigate trends in the number of orders over the years, monthly seasonality, and time of day for order placements.
3. Evolution of E-commerce Orders: Analyze the month-on-month orders placed in each state and customer distribution across states.
4. Impact on Economy: Examine the movement of money through e-commerce, including changes in order prices and freight costs.
5. Analysis on Sales, Freight, and Delivery Time: Determine delivery time and differences between estimated and actual delivery dates, identify states with high/low average freight values and delivery times, and assess states with fast delivery compared to estimated dates.
6. Analysis Based on Payments: Analyze the month-on-month orders placed using different payment types and the number of orders based on payment installments.
